        <h5>Important Disclaimer</h5>
        <p><strong>This is not an official company careers page.</strong> This is a personal project that aggregates job listings from various sources. Always visit the company's official careers page to verify job availability and apply directly through their official channels.</p>
        
        <p>I scan job listings regularly with the aim of indexing all jobs at least once every 24 hours, but I cannot guarantee specific update times. During the scanning process, if any job posting contains incorrect or incomplete information, it is automatically disregarded and will not appear in the search results.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Welcome to my job aggregator — a simple, efficient tool designed to make job hunting faster and easier.</p>

    <p>This app collects job postings from multiple sources and brings them together in one place. You can filter listings by job title, and when you find one that interests you, clicking the result will take you directly to the company's official careers page.</p>

    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
    
    </br>

    <p>I'm an engineer, hacker, and cybersecurity expert — a hacker in the original, noble sense of the word: someone who loves to understand how things work, often by taking them apart and putting them back together. I enjoy building things that solve real problems, and right now, the problem I'm solving is my own.</p>

    <p>I created this app as a personal project while between jobs. Like many others, I found myself spending a lot of time searching across countless sites for opportunities. This tool automates that process — and I hope it can help others, too.</p>

    <p>This project is a blend of curiosity, necessity, and passion — built not for profit, but for purpose.</p>
